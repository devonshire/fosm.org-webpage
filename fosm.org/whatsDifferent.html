			<h1>What&apos;s Different?</h1>
			<p>
				If you are familiar with OpenStreetMap you may want to know what&apos;s different about fosm
				and learn why you should contribute to fosm rather than OpenStreetMap.  This page summarises
				the main differences.

	<h2>Differences</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			The main difference is, of course, the license.  Fosm content is licensed under the Creative Commons
			CC&nbsp;BY-SA license rather than OpenStreetMap&apos;s combination of Contributor Terms (CTs), Open Database 
			License (ODbL), and Database Content License (DbCL).  We think our license is much simpler and easier to
			understand.  It relies on copyright which is the traditional mechanism for protecting maps and follows
			well known and understood legal principles.
		</li>
		<li>
			The fosm philosophy is a little different from OpenStreetMap.  We believe in distributed everything with
			minimal centralized control. 
		</li>
		<li>
			The fosm server platform is different and more technically advanced than OpenStreetMap.  Rather than
			using a vast array of services spread across multiple servers, fosm runs on a single much smaller server.
			This is possible because we use a more sophisticated database and a very thin application layer.  For
			resilience the database is replicated, in real time, to a backup server located on a different continent.  
		</li>

		<li>
			Way splits and merges are recorded more carefully in fosm than in OpenStreetMap.  A special tag 
			meta:predecessors is used to indicate if a version of a way has been derived from one or more other
			ways.  This tag is generated automatically by fosm after any editing session.
		</li>
